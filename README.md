# Magic-Menu-Indicator
A Reactive Menu Indicator which reacts when clicked 
Created this after watching a video on youtube and tried to recreate it from memory. 
The idea is to help me practice what I learn. 
So, every other day, I read some blogs or watch a video on people's codes and try to recreate them whilst applying what I have learnt from coding.
These are to act as milestones on my journey to growth
